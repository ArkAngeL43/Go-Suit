this is a pretty massive golang project ive been working on, sure ive made scripts like red rabbit, and even GO-Liath however this isnt a cyber weapon, its something people could utilize and make use of. ever since the dawn of computers they have been used to make peoples lives easier EG something like hacking, bug bounty, IT jobs, or even regular jobs and life. i decided to make some functions that bash reguallary doesnt have and if it does make it faster with the use and programming language Go-Lang, something new but fresh and really fast not only that but go alone for how fast it is is really readable which makes it better for younger developers.

Ctrl C is locked unless you are running a live process in that terminal then it will be executed and killed 

when prompted to the menu use help, command, commands, or Help to reach the commands menu, this will be prompted pretty quickly

 what about speed? 

time.sleep or any method in the script to mark how long it will take to execute or do a certian thing is limited to JUST LIVE MONITORS LIKE GO SERVE OR NET MON OR SCRAP

other than that most commands are executed extremely fast, for example dumping hexes, getting network info, IP addresses, interfaces, dates to the nanosecon, and even parsing a URl, everything should execute rather fast asides speedtest which is out of my control
